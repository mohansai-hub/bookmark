    <p>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (/ˈrɑːmən/;[1] 7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist[2] known for his work in the field of light scattering.[3] Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called modified scattering was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. In 1930, Raman received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery and was the first Asian and non-White to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.[4]</p>

    <p>Raman was born in Tiruchirappalli in the Madras Presidency of British India (now Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India) to Tamil Iyer Brahmin parents,[5][6] Chandrasekhar Ramanathan Iyer and Parvathi Ammal.[7] He was the second of eight siblings.[8] His father was a teacher at a local high school, and earned a modest income. He recalled: "I was born with a copper spoon in my mouth. At my birth my father was earning the magnificent salary of ten rupees per month!"[9] In 1892, his family moved to Visakhapatnam (then Vizagapatam or Vizag) in Andhra Pradesh as his father was appointed to the faculty of physics at Mrs A.V. Narasimha Rao College.[10]

        Raman was educated at the St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School, Visakhapatnam.[11] He passed matriculation at age 11 and the First Examination in Arts examination (equivalent to today's intermediate examination, pre-university course) with a scholarship at age 13,[8][12] securing first position in both under the Andhra Pradesh school board (now Andhra Pradesh Board of Secondary Education) examination.[13]

    <p>Raman's elder brother Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar had joined the prestigious Indian government service, Indian Finance Service (now Indian Audit and Accounts Service).[23] Raman followed suit and qualified for the Indian Finance Service achieving first position in the entrance examination in February 1907.[24] He was posted in Calcutta (now Kolkata) as Assistant Accountant General in June 1907.[10]

        He was highly impressed by the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Calcutta, the first research institute founded in India in 1876.[22] He immediately befriended Asutosh Dey (who would eventually become his lifelong collaborator), Amrita Lal Sircar (the founder Mahendralal Sircar's son and secretary of IACS), and Ashutosh Mukherjee (executive member of the IACS and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta). With their support, he obtained permission to conduct research at IACS in his own time even "at very unusual hours," as Raman later reminisced.[13] Up to that time the institute had not yet recruited regular researchers,[25] or produced any research paper.[10] Raman's article "Newton's rings in polarised light" published in Nature in 1907 became the first from the institute.[26] The work inspired IACS to publish a journal, Bulletin of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, in 1909 in which Raman was the major contributor.[13]</p>

    <p>One of Raman's interests was on the scientific basis of musical sounds. He was inspired by Hermann von Helmholtz's The Sensations of Tone, the book he came across when he joined IACS.[24] He published his findings prolifically between 1916 and 1921. He worked out the theory of transverse vibration of bowed string instruments based on superposition of velocities. One of his earliest studies was on the wolf tone in violins and cellos.[43][44] He studied the acoustics of various violin and related instruments, including Indian stringed instruments,[45][46] and water splashes.[47] He even performed what he called "Experiments with mechanically-played violins."[48]</p>

    <p>At the end of October 1970, Raman had a cardiac arrest and collapsed in his laboratory. He was moved to the hospital where doctors diagnosed his condition and declared that he would not survive for another four hours.[147] He however survived a few days and requested to stay in the gardens of his institute surrounded by his followers and fans.[148]

        Two days before Raman died, he told one of his former students, "Do not allow the journals of the Academy to die, for they are the sensitive indicators of the quality of science being done in the country and whether science is taking root in it or not."[42] That evening, Raman met with the Board of Management of his institute in his bedroom and discussed with them the fate of the institute's management.[148] He also willed his wife to perform a simple cremation without any rituals upon his death. He died from natural causes early the next morning on 21 November 1970 at the age of 82.[147]</p>
